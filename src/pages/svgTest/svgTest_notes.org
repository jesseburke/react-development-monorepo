- axes display and center click don't work on zooming  

- should test transform functions...write tests for them?
    
  
** graph paper

would like some range of squares to always be displayed, e.g., between
40 and 60 
   
** axes

display xMin, xMax, yMin, yMax on the graph   
   
** function graph
   
** DONE zoom buttons

   also display level of zoom, and make that editable?
   
** zoom with touch pad
