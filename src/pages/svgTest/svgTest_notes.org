* to fix

 - [X] control bar height shrink when window is resized
   ( was due to svg not being absolutely positioned)
 - [X] origin circle is getting too big on large zoom



 
* to add

** DONE coordinate transform atom(s)
   :LOGBOOK:
   - State "DONE"       from              [2021-06-16 Wed 21:46]

   :END:

- [X] axes display and center click don't work on zooming  

- [X] should test transform functions...write tests for them?
    
  
** graph paper

would like some range of squares to always be displayed, e.g., between
40 and 60...should use actual height of svg for part of bound? e.g.,
should show more squares on large monitor than on cell phone. 
   
** axes

display xMin, xMax, yMin, yMax on the graph   
   
** function graph
   
** DONE zoom buttons

   - State "DONE"       from              [2021-06-11 Fri 12:54]
   :END:

   also display level of zoom, and make that editable?
   
** zoom with touch pad


   
* idea: can we pass SvgScene children a context, that they can get atoms from?
