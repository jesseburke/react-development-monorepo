* to fix

 - [X] control bar height shrink when window is resized
   ( was due to svg not being absolutely positioned)
 - [X] origin circle is getting too big on large zoom

 - [ ] grey out the zoom buttons when max/min is reached

 
* to add

** DONE coordinate transform atom(s)

   :END:

- [X] axes display and center click don't work on zooming  

- [X] should test transform functions...write tests for them?
    
  
** DONE graph paper

** axes

- [X] display xMin, xMax, yMin, yMax on the graph

- [ ] pass, and use, axesData

   also display level of zoom, and make that editable?
   
** zoom with touch pad

   - [X] have to make zoom atom accept argument for zooming
   - [ ] move svg atom code from App_svgTest_atoms to somewhere that it's
     reusable?



   
* symmetry apps

- would like to keep points the primary data
- these can transformed into svg or mesh
- maybe have mesh component that wraps such points data, and can use
  it to create 'expanding mesh'
- no need to create one big mesh, can have array of meshes. will be
  useful for: un/redoing, erasing, transforming pieces, etc.
- would be very cool to have mode to edit the points that define the shape
